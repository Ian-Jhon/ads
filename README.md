**A Python module to interact with NASA's ADS that doesn't suckâ„¢**
==================================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andycasey/ads-python.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andycasey/ads-python)

If you're in research, then you pretty much _need_ NASA's ADS. It's tried, true, and on the rare occasions when it goes down, people go crazy on Twitter.

I wanted some way to be able to easily search ADS from the terminal, and a mate wanted a way to make visualisations from all the ADS data. So I've written this module to use the new API from NASA ADS. Hooray!

**First Steps**

1. You'll need a developer API key from NASA ADS labs first. Fill out this form.

2. When you get your developer API, save it to a file called ``~/.ads/dev_key``

3. Happy hacking.


I'll put some examples and visualisations up here when I can.
